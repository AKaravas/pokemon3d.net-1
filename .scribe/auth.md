# Authenticating requests

Authenticate requests to this API's endpoints by sending an **`Authorization`** header with the value **`"Bearer {YOUR_TOKEN}"`**.

All authenticated endpoints are marked with a `requires authentication` badge in the documentation below.

You can retrieve your token by logging in normally and then click your profile top-right, in the menu you should see <b>API token</b> (if you have access).
